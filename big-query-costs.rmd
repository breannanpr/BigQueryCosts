## Assignment Overview

In this short project, I will estimate some of the costs that are associated with Big Query and come up with strategies to mitigate those costs. 

```{sql connection=}
## Here is my SQL Query

```


How much data is processed by the query? 

How much data would be processed by the query against a full year of data? 

What is the cost of running the query against a full year of data? 

What would be the cost of running the query against a full year of data every six hours for a year?

## Queries
`SELECT COUNT(*)` from the table.

`SELECT location, COUNT(*)` from the table.

`SELECT url, location` from the table.

`SELECT url, raw_html, location` for just the "missoula" location from the table.

## Additional Questions
Based on the data gathered above, what types of queries appear to be driving the costs? 

How would you recommend structuring the project to keep costs down?
